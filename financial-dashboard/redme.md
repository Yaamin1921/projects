You are a backend software engineer at an e-commerce company.
Your team is responsible for a mission-critical Financial Dashboard web application.
After many years of development without any underlining framework,
the codebase became extremely tightly coupled and disorganized which made further development very slow,
difficult, and risky. The lack of a standard way to externally configure the application behavior 
without making code changes also limits the ability to iterate and add new features. 
The team's Software Architect concluded that by switching to a modern framework that enforces 
the Dependency Injection Design Pattern and allows for easy external configuration, 
all those problems should be solved. 
Your job is to rearchitect the Financial Dashboard web application to use Spring Boot
